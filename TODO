NOTE:
        TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.

        TODOs in TO-BE-DONE are ordered in a least-to-last important order.
        Take in charge whatever TODO you like to complete but remember that
        the least important are probably the blocking ones ... so they should
        be completed first ...

        When a TODO in TO-BE-DONE has been completed it must be moved to DONE
        or DONE-RECHECK if it needs further checking.

        In DONE and DONE-RECHECK a date or a release version (the same that
        the ChangeLog shows) number should be added too (in order to remember
        when that TODO has been declared completed ...

TO-BE-DONE:
* Add support for choosing the right page's DTD.
* Oversimplify site configuration (having it in a single file would be a 
  good thing); at the same time think, add and handle a site map indexing.
* Add Options.pm module in order to wrap Perl's Getopt::Long.
* Develop tools/script/perl-autofrisk.in with Guile's autofrisk in mind.

DONE:
0.1.107:
* Add /libs/site/layout.scm in order to handle a generic layout to be used 
  if a specific layout is not defined. Its structure should be like the one 
  found in template-body (/libs/site/template.scm) procedure.

0.1.46:
* Add lists (ordered, unordered, definition and nested), debug and verbose 
  messages and comments to src/filters/wikitext-sxml.in.

* Write a tutorial for Wikitext.

DONE-RECHECK:
