NOTE:
        TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.

        TODOs in TO-BE-DONE are ordered in a least-to-last important order.
        Take in charge whatever TODO you like to complete but remember that
        the least important are probably the blocking ones ... so they should
        be completed first ...

        When a TODO in TO-BE-DONE has been completed it must be moved to DONE
        or DONE-RECHECK if it needs further checking.

        In DONE and DONE-RECHECK a date or a release version (the same that
        the ChangeLog shows) number should be added too (in order to remember
        when that TODO has been declared completed ...

TO-BE-DONE:
* Remove the --brief option handling (out-dated)

* Add to preprocessor the capability to evaluate expressions in its
  macros with environment variables translation.

* Fix all the system() calls. A boom is assured if they don't find the
  executable they are looking for.

* Add a feature to choose a global layout via command line switch.

* Add a feature to choose a layout for each page (now we've a common one).

* Add RSS generation

* Add support for choosing the right page's DTD. We should have a global site
  DTD and the option to override it on each page.

* Simplify site configuration (having it in a single file would be a 
  good thing); at the same time think, add and handle a site map indexing.

DONE:
* Add handling for subopts in Options.pm module.

* Strenghten libs/perl/Sitetool/Options.pm module with argument shifter in
  order to give place to some options amongst the other.

* Add code into the libs/perl/Sitetool/Options.pm module in order to have a
  cleaner option parsing method.

* Add option bundling in libs/perl/Sitetool/Base/Options.pm module

* Develop tools/script/perl-autofrisk in order to mimic the Guile's autofrisk
  script. The script should be integrated into the bootstrap script.

* Change tests structure in order to be able to specify a per-test data
  directory.

0.1.107:
* Add /libs/site/layout.scm in order to handle a generic layout to be used 
  if a specific layout is not defined. Its structure should be like the one 
  found in template-body (/libs/site/template.scm) procedure.

0.1.46:
* Add lists (ordered, unordered, definition and nested), debug and verbose 
  messages and comments to src/filters/wikitext-sxml.in.

* Write a tutorial for Wikitext.

DONE-RECHECK:
