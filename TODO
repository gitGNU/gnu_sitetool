NOTE:
	TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.
	When a TODO item has been completed it should be moved to DONE or
	DONE-RECHECK, if it needs further checking.
	In DONE and DONE-RECHECK status a date or a release version tag should
	be added too.

TO-BE-DONE:
* Fix --dry-run option in all scripts help() sub

* Add sitemap related plugin in order to generate sitemaps index files

* Check all string-related assert

* Do a general clean-up of SITETOOL_BINARY_PATH, SITETOOL_DATA_PATH and
  SITETOOL_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables. Consider removing the
  SITETOOL_RC_FILES environment variable references or update all the src/*
  scripts accordingly

* Remove the --brief option handling (out-dated)

* Add to preprocessor the capability to evaluate expressions in its
  macros with environment variables translation.

* Fix all the system() calls. A boom is assured if they don't find the
  executable they are looking for.

* Add a feature to choose a global layout via command line switch.

* Add a feature to choose a layout for each page (now we've a common one).

* Add RSS generation

* Add support for choosing the right page's DTD. We should have a global site
  DTD and the option to override it on each page.

* Simplify site configuration (having it in a single file would be a 
  good thing); at the same time think, add and handle a site map indexing.

DONE:
* Add handling for subopts in Options.pm module.

* Strenghten libs/perl/Sitetool/Options.pm module with argument shifter in
  order to give place to some options amongst the other.

* Add code into the libs/perl/Sitetool/Options.pm module in order to have a
  cleaner option parsing method.

* Add option bundling in libs/perl/Sitetool/Base/Options.pm module

* Develop tools/script/perl-autofrisk in order to mimic the Guile's autofrisk
  script. The script should be integrated into the bootstrap script.

* Change tests structure in order to be able to specify a per-test data
  directory.

0.1.107:
* Add /libs/site/layout.scm in order to handle a generic layout to be used 
  if a specific layout is not defined. Its structure should be like the one 
  found in template-body (/libs/site/template.scm) procedure.

0.1.46:
* Add lists (ordered, unordered, definition and nested), debug and verbose 
  messages and comments to src/filters/wikitext-sxml.in.

* Write a tutorial for Wikitext.

DONE-RECHECK:
