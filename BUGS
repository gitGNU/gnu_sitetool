KNOWN BUGS:

* The parser doesn't accepts comments like:

     /// This is a comment

  while it accepts comment like:

     // This is a comment

* The main script get confused by an input file name different from the
  standard one ... the motivation resides in the %tool variable. It is
  composed by concatenated strings and they get concatenated at "compilation"
  time. Probably we should use refs to these strings instead ...
