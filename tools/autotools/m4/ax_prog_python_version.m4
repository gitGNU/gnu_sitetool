#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_PYTHON_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Makes sure that python supports the version indicated. If true the
#   shell commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell
#   commands in ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $PYTHON is not set (for
#   example by running AC_CHECK_PROG or AC_PATH_PROG),
#
#   Example:
#
#     AC_PATH_PROG([PYTHON],[python])
#     AC_PROG_PYTHON_VERSION([2.4.4],[ ... ],[ ... ])
#
#   This will check to make sure that the python you have supports at
#   least version 2.4.4.
#
# NOTE
#
#   This macro uses the PYTHON variable to perform the check. The PYTHON_VERSION
#   variable will be valorized with the detected version
