#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_PERL_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Makes sure that perl supports the version indicated. If true the
#   shell commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell
#   commands in ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $PERL is not set (for
#   example by running AC_CHECK_PROG or AC_PATH_PROG),
#
#   Example:
#
#     AC_PATH_PROG([PERL],[perl])
#     AC_PROG_PERL_VERSION([5.8.0],[ ... ],[ ... ])
#
#   This will check to make sure that the perl you have supports at
#   least version 5.8.0.
#
# NOTE
#
#   This macro uses the PERL variable to perform the check. The PERL_VERSION
#   variable will be valorized with the detected version
