# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_WITH_PYTHON([VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND],[PATH])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Locates an installed Python binary, placing the result in the
#   precious variable PYTHON. Accepts a present PYTHON, then
#   --with-python, and failing that searches for python in the given
#   path (which defaults to the system path). If python is found,
#   PYTHON is set to the full path of the binary; if it is not found,
#   PYTHON is set to VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND, which defaults to 'python'.
