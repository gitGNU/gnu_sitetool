# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_WITH([VARIABLE],[program],[PATH],[VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Locates an installed program binary, placing the result in the
#   precious variable $VARIABLE. Accepts a present $VARIABLE, then
#   --with-program, and failing that searches for program in the given
#   path (which defaults to the system path). If program is found,
#   $VARIABLE is set to the full path of the binary; if it is not found,
#   $VARIABLE is set to VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND, which defaults to 'program'.
#
# NOTE
#   This macro is based upon AX_WITH_PYTHON macro from Dustin J. Mitchell
#   <dustin@cs.uchicago.edu>
