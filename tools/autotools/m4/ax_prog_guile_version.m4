#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_GUILE_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Makes sure that guile supports the version indicated. If true the
#   shell commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell
#   commands in ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $GUILE is not set (for
#   example by running AC_CHECK_PROG or AC_PATH_PROG),
#
#   Example:
#
#     AC_PATH_PROG([GUILE],[guile])
#     AC_PROG_GUILE_VERSION([1.6.0],[ ... ],[ ... ])
#
#   This will check to make sure that the guile you have supports at
#   least version 1.6.0.
#
# NOTE
#
#   This macro uses the GUILE variable to perform the check. The GUILE_VERSION
#   variable will be valorized with the detected version
