Plugin "wikitext-sxml" takes a plain text file (formatted as shown below) 
and outputs the same contents in SXML format. \\\
As for HTML, input file is splitted into ___ major section ___ known as 
/// block level elements /// ; block level element is splitted into ___ 
minor section ___ known as /// inline level elements /// . \\\
Block level contains the following elements:

* headings
* paragraphs
* lists
* preformatted texts
* horizontal rules
* generic block level container (aka "div")

Inline level contains the following elements:

* bold text formatting
* italic text formatting
* underlined text formatting
* anchors (references to URL or e-mail addresses)
* images
* line breaking
* generic inline level container (aka "span")

Block level elements are separated by one or more empy lines and can't be 
nested, while inline level elements are separated by one or more space 
characters or should be nested. \\\
Let's go deeper...

=== Block level elements ===

==== Headings ====

We could have 5 level of headings (as HTML):

{{pre}}
- level 1
  Wikitext: == text ==
  SXML    : (h1 "text")

- level 2
  Wikitext: === text ===
  SXML    : (h2 "text")

- level 3
  Wikitext: ==== text ====
  SXML    : (h3 "text")

- level 4
  Wikitext: ===== text =====
  SXML    : (h4 "text")

- level 5
  Wikitext: ====== text ======
  SXML    : (h5 "text")
{{pre}}

==== Paragraphs ====

No much words here... Just type and we got a paragraph ;-)

==== Lists ====

Single lists and nested lists are supported; we could have:

{{pre}}
- unordered list
  Wikitext:
            * item 1
            * item 2
  SXML:
            (ul (li "item 1") (li "item 2"))

- ordered list
  Wikitext:
            # item 1
            # item 2
  SXML:
            (ol (li "item 1") (li "item 2"))

- definition list
  Wikitext:
            ; definition term
            : definition definition
  SXML:
            (dl (dt "definition term") (dd "definition definition"))
{{pre}}

==== Preformatted texts ====

For preformatted text we should begin and end a block level with 
'{{pre}}' (without quotes):

{{pre}}
Wikitext:
          '{{pre}}'
          text
          '{{pre}}'
SXML:
          (pre "text")
{{pre}}

==== Horizontal rules ====

We could put an horizontal rule simply writing '---' (without quotes) on 
a line:

{{pre}}
Wikitext:
          ---
SXML:
          (hr )
{{pre}}

==== Generic block level container ====

Better known as "div", this element should be generic or belong to specific 
class and should start with '[[div]]' or '[[div|name]]' (without quotes) 
tag:

{{pre}} 
Wikitext:
          {{div}}
          contents
SXML:
          (div (`contents))

Wikitext:
          {{div|name}}
          contents
SXML:
          (div (@ (class "name")) (`contents))
{{pre}}

=== Inline level elements ===

==== Bold text formatting ====

Bold text should be obtained by surrounding it with '+++' (without quotes):

{{pre}}
Wikitext:
          *** text ***
SXML:
          (b "text")
{{pre}}

==== Italic text formatting ====

Bold text should be obtained by surrounding it with '///' (without quotes):

{{pre}}
Wikitext:
          /// text ///
SXML:
          (i "text")
{{pre}}

==== Underlined text formatting ====

Bold text should be obtained by surrounding it with '___' (without quotes):

{{pre}}
Wikitext:
          ___ text ___
SXML:
          (u "text")
{{pre}}

==== Anchors ====

We could have anchor that point to an URL or e-mail address; generically it 
has the form '[[<type>:<source> <text> ]]' (without quotes), where type 
could be 'url' or 'email', source (according to type) could be an URL or an 
e-mail address and text is optional (if it'snt specified it will be like 
source):

{{pre}}
Wikitext:
          [[url:http://www.gnu.org/ GNU's Not Unix! ]]
SXML:
          (a (@ (href "http://www.gnu.org/")) "GNU's Not Unix!" ]]
Wikitext:
          [[url:http://www.gnu.org/ ]]
SXML:
          (a (@ (href "http://www.gnu.org/")) "http://www.gnu.org/" ]]

Wikitext:
          [[email:gnu@gnu.org GNU e-mail ]]
SXML:
          (a (href "mailto:gnu@gnu.org") "GNU e-mail" ]]
Wikitext:
          [[email:gnu@gnu.org ]]
SXML:
          (a (href "mailto:gnu@gnu.org") "gnu@gnu.org" ]]
{{pre}}

Text to anchor is treated as an inline level element, so we could format it 
as we want.

==== Images ====

Images are treated like anchors and their syntax is '[[image:<source> 
<text> ]]', where source is the path to image and text is put in the 
alternate text attribute of image (if it'snt specified, it will be 
like source):

{{pre}}
Wikitext:
          [[image:../images/test.png Image fo testing ]]
SXML:
          (img (@ (src "../images/test.png") (alt "Image fo testing"))
Wikitext:
          [[image:../images/test.png ]]
SXML:
          (img (@ (src "../images/test.png") (alt "../images/test.png"))
{{pre}}

==== Line breaking ====

Easily break a line:

{{pre}}
\\\
{{pre}}

==== Generic inline container ====

Better known as "span", this element should be generic or belong to specific 
class and should start with '{{span contents }}' or '{{span|<name> text }}' 
(without quotes) tag:

{{pre}} 
Wikitext:
          {{span text }}
SXML:
          (span "text")

Wikitext:
          {{span|name text }}
SXML:
          (span (@ (class "name")) "contents")
{{pre}}

=== Output of the previous examples ===

== Heading level 1 ==

=== Heading level 2 ===

==== Heading level 3 ====

===== Heading level 4 =====

====== Heading level 5 ======

* unordered list item 1
* unordered list item 2

# ordered list item 1
# ordered list item 2

; definition list term
: definition list definition 1
: definition list definition 2

This is a paragraph.

{{pre}}
This is a preformatted text.
{{pre}}

---

{{div}}
This is inside a "div"

+++ Bold text +++ , /// italic text /// and ___ underlined text ___ . \\\
[[url:http://www.gnu.org/ GNU's Not Unix! ]] \\\
[[url:http://www.gnu.org/ ]] \\\
[[email:gnu@gnu.org GNU e-mail ]] \\\
[[email:gnu@gnu.org ]] \\\
[[image:../images/test.png Image fo testing ]] \\\
[[image:../images/test.png ]]

{{span text inside a "span" }}
{{span|test text inside a "span" with class "test" }}
